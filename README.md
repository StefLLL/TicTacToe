This is a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game made with Python 3.
It has a simple UI made with tkinter.

Launch main to play the game. crystal_ball contains the class that is used by the computer to choose its move.
This is a simple hardcoded algorythm. It's very beatable, in fact it only operates to make winning moves or prevent the player to make a winning move. It has a 1/10 chance to make a random play.

I'm currently learning how to code so this project is defined by my inability to use OOP effectively or advanced functions like minimax.
